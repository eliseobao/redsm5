s_1270_9,"I'm not sleeping, and my stomach constantly aches. I recently self-diagnosed with ADHD, C-PTSD, and maybe ASD, with severe executive dysfunction. After escaping my abusive parents, I started living alone and couldn’t even manage basic things like feeding myself. If not for food delivery, I probably wouldn’t be alive. I can’t stand takeout anymore. This has been my reality for two years, and my health has only declined. I remember right after fleeing, I spent weeks lying on the floor, completely paralyzed by fear. Eventually, I managed to pause everything. My sleep pattern was a mess—I stayed up all night watching anime or playing games, and slept through the day. Lately, my stomach pain has gotten worse, and I guess skipping breakfast for two years is catching up with me. I did manage to fix my sleep for two months, but now I’m back to not sleeping until the sun comes up. Every panic attack feels more suicidal than the last. I have too many dreams for one lifetime and don’t want to die, but this suffering feels inhuman. Ironically, my ADHD has kept me from focusing enough to self-harm—but I know that won’t last forever."
s_1955_1069,"Seriously, how dare someone feel bad just because a racist joke was told? I honestly feel so attacked right now."
s_993_1060,"At first, I felt amazing. I had tons of energy and was super productive for two to three months. But then everything started to fall apart. Now I can’t focus at all. My sleep has worsened, and I’ve had to start using sleeping pills. I'm stuck in a constant state of low mood."
s_321_219,"I hate being so sensitive. I wish none of this affected me, but it does—and I cry, a lot. I’ve cried at least once in front of every person I know in real life, and I absolutely hate myself for it. I hate how my emotions affect people. I’m crying right now and I hate being so weak. My life isn’t even terrible, but I feel like such a mess. This week has been especially rough—I’ve cried every single day."
s_2392_17,"I spent 20 years trying different treatments with no success. Then I stopped eating dairy, and suddenly I’m sleeping a solid 6 to 8 hours most nights. There was a time when I barely slept—only around six hours in a week. One change I did make recently is switching to 50mg of Trazodone, but even now if I eat just a couple of eggs during the day, I can’t sleep at all that night. I don’t know why I didn’t try this earlier—there weren’t any signs of an allergy or sensitivity. Or maybe I’m just convincing myself I’m not completely clueless. Either way, I’m really relieved that the insomnia seems to be over. I hope others still struggling find something that works. It’s a rough road."
s_1997_963,"Choosing a name sounds so tough. I'm extremely indecisive—if I were in your position, I'd never be able to pick one."
s_1404_102,"Please read everything before offering advice—I’ve tried most things already. I’m a 21-year-old guy with average looks and poor social skills due to ASD and introversion. I can’t relate to extroverted behavior and hate small talk. Dating is tough: no girlfriend, no dates. I’m not ugly, but not attractive enough for dating apps. Even when I get matches, I get ghosted. I’ve had conversations with women in groups but never know how to move things forward. I also have no real hobbies because of my depression, so I never know what to talk about. I’m willing to do fun things with someone, but being alone, I do nothing. I wish I could connect with quiet, introverted women, but I don’t know where to find them. Dating apps don’t work, and my social circle doesn’t help. I try to improve socially, but it’s exhausting and never natural. I keep trying, but I’m lost."
s_205_396,"I’m 26 and honestly, I’ve never been interested in sex or romantic relationships—and it’s never really bothered me."
s_2886_101,"It’s hard to absorb anything when you feel miserable. In major depression, neurotransmitters like dopamine and serotonin get thrown off, and your brain just stops working right. I’ve had both depression and major depression. I came out of a year-long episode but still struggle to focus. Sometimes even conversations slip right past me. It's improving slowly, though."
s_993_557,"I don’t even fully get it, but I spent two and a half months stuck in bed, barely holding onto my job. My elderly parents supported me the whole time, and I feel incredibly guilty about it."
s_1639_444,"I was prescribed prednisone for a possible ear infection. I have a tube in my left ear that’s been there over a year. My kids were recently sick, and now I feel run-down too. Swollen lymph node, ear pressure, fatigue—I slept 10 hours last night and still needed a nap. I don’t want this turning into another bad infection like before. How long should I wait before seeing a doctor in person?"
s_2338_920,"Just need to vent. I nearly hit a family—including a pregnant woman—while backing out in a crowded parking lot. A big truck blocked my view. People were yelling, I panicked, apologized, and drove off. Now I can’t stop crying and worrying that I hit someone without realizing. I didn’t feel anything, but I’m terrified I’ll get in trouble. I’ve calmed down now, but it shook me badly. Thanks to everyone who’s helped me feel a bit better."
s_156_366,"I can’t go to college alone. Without support, I know I’ll end up taking my own life. I’m barely getting by now and the thought of facing everything alone terrifies me. I don’t want to hurt anyone, but I wish the world would end so I could stop suffering. I don’t know what to do anymore."
s_2748_341,"My sex drive has always been intense—I'm 28 and extremely into anything sexual. It gives me temporary relief. I'm very attracted to the female body, even outside of romantic relationships. My partners haven’t matched my energy, which is frustrating. I’m now stable on antidepressants and trying to fix my sleep. But I still only sleep in short, weird bursts."
s_1404_1048,"Why can’t I sleep early, even if I wake up early and I’m completely drained? Unless I don’t set an alarm, I never get enough rest. I’ve tried everything—calm setting, darkness, exhaustion—and still can’t sleep early. But if I go to bed late, I fall asleep easily. It’s clearly a timing issue, and I don’t get why school and work expect early sleep like it’s natural for everyone."
s_329_224,"Looking back, I see how many mistakes I made. I should’ve waited longer for the medication to work and avoided taking theanine, which messes with neurotransmitter balance. The antidepressants didn’t help either. Just a few things to keep in mind if I ever try again."
s_2748_278,"When I started Celexa, I had to lower the dose after two weeks because I was constantly exhausted. I’d sleep over 14 hours and still wake up feeling drained. I still wish I had more energy, but at least I’m not depressed anymore."
