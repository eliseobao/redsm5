"Voices of Recovery - Daily Meditation: Dec 20 December 20 Step Two offers hope that sanity is possible, and at the same time it implies that, in our addiction, we were insane. Sex Addicts Anonymous, page 25 When I first read this sentence, I had to pause and ask myself if I were truly insane. Step One required me to admit that I am a sex addict and a sexual anorexic, that I am powerless over these illnesses, and that my life is unmanageable by me. Since I believe that I am a sex addict and a sexual anorexic, that means I have a disease of the mind, body, and spirit that reacts very negatively to all sexual stimuli. For me, unhealthy sexual stimuli can lead to addictive sexual behaviors, and healthy sexual stimuli, such as sexual intimacy with my husband, can lead to sexual avoidance or addictive sexual behaviors. But, being a sex addict also means I have a mental obsession with sexual stimuli of all kinds. To me, thats like someone with a peanut allergy having a mental obsession with finding and eating peanuts. Wouldnt I call that person insane? Yes, I would. So it clearly means that I am, in fact, insane. Without God and the SAA program, my default desires are to harm myself with addictive sexual behavior and starve myself of healthy sexuality. Believing God can restore me to sanity means believing that God will change my whole being so that I no longer desire harmful sexual stimuli and I no longer avoid nurturing sexual stimuli, one day and one step at a time. May I be willing to go to any lengths today to be restored to sanity.",NO_SYMPTOMS,"The previous post would suggest the presence of a loss of interest in sex by a sexual disorder. However, the information and meaning of this post do not express the loss of pleasure in sex. For this reason, it is not possible to affirm the sexual disorder related to Major depressive disorders as the second symptom of criteria for diagnosis in the DSM-5. Although this comment expresses a possible loss of interest in sex by changes in sexual behavior, in this context, the person affirms the high sexual activity that could be related to a sexual disorder. For This reason, it is not possible to confirm the presence of major depressive symptoms as the markedly diminished interest in pleasure according to DSM-5."

It took three months to get them to trust me. Three months spent in virtual isolation; three months spent eating one step better than garbage just to survive. I figured makeshift prisons run by Chinese rebels would hardly be luxurious, but those three months will haunt my sleep if I survive this. Until the day this struggle ends, there are far worse nightmares to faceand while awake. That Starbucks, that day, those seven Venti coffees; I broke something in myself three months ago while sitting at that table guzzling stimulant. Out the window and across the street I could see ramshackle ghettos, while on my side of the divide everything was clean, bright, and happy. Each coffee subtly changed that dynamic. I would say that the ideal level of caffeination for busy-bee workers is somewhere between half a Venti black coffee at minimum and two full ones at maximum. While in that range, every sip I took gradually shrank my awareness in a way only an experienced caffeine addict could notice. Creativity and thinking outside the box became slightly harder while focusing on specific mundane tasks became slightly easier. In that regard, I almost became more concerned with writing down my changing symptoms than with actually drinking the coffee. It took an act of will to force myself to proceed. I'd kicked caffeine for the first time in years, but now I'd given myself back to it, and my brain was very happy with the flood of energy. It wanted to enjoy the high; it did not want to keep drinking with the specific intent to make myself sick. Nevertheless, I began gulping more even as my pulse rose and my fingers began subtly shaking. The third full coffee brought the change in the world's tone to a noticeable level. The bright colors had faded in favor of greys and browns, and the street outside was dingy and cracked in small ways I had not noticed before. The ghetto across from me remained horrible; I watched a haggard mother hang laundry on a high rope strung between two rotting wooden spires. Each breath brought that surge of fire I recognized as the limit of caffeination, and I had to carefully regulate myself to keep my heart rate down. For now, I was still fine, but I was only at three of seven coffees. Taking a deep breath, I chugged the fourth. The tilt in my perceptions nearly made me slide from my seat. The world had not shifted physically, but my sense of myself within it certainly had. Looking around, I sighted for the first time bits of garbage, rust, and decay on my side of the divide. People walking on the streets didn't seem to notice; one stepped in what looked like dog excrement but continued walking without bothering to scrape it off. I watched three workers inside the Starbucks itself ignore a small pile of trash that customers kept stepping on. But still I was submerged in a long, deep, and slow river of complacency. My body was agitated, but my mind was full of excuses not to notice, mention, or otherwise regard these strange discrepancies. Downing the fifth coffee rapidly as a way of surprising myself and breaking through that submersion, I clutched the edges of control to stay centered. Each gasp brought oxygen, while each exhalation brought fuzziness at the edges of my vision. I began to feel claustrophobic and unsafe. Rusted corners and smelly bits of garbage made themselves prominent in my awareness; I slung my bag and grabbed my two remaining coffees and stumbled out onto the street. The sub-provincial city of Guangzhou no longer looked to me as all the others that I had visited. I could see character now, mostly in aged buildings off the main path, and the bright colors and cleanliness had been stripped away. This place was run down and industrial, and I had not seen it as such until my fifth coffee. The sixth filled me with very unpleasant internal heat. I'd come here ostensibly to investigate a claim that had caught my eye; I was within a block of that location, and wandered along my side of the street opposite the ghetto to investigate the site of the supposed accident. It was a simple alleyway, much like the one in Jerusalem, but this one held stacks of garbage and low pools of unidentifiable filth. I braved the muck to search the walls, and, this time, I was ready when I found the unknown invisible vines. Here goes nothing, indeed. I kept my eyes on the wall and downed my seventh and final coffee. The pain in my head became two directed blades moving through my forehead and temples. I winced, but kept my gaze forward. I needed to see this. If seven coffees didn't blow open the flaw in the lie, nothing would. Someone had pulled the wool over my eyes, and forcing it out of my system was the only way. Shivering horribly and fighting a body-wide surge of dangerous over-stimulation, I watched with triumph as patchwork lines began to weave themselves into existence before me. It was the same material that the doctor in Zimbabwe had found in Kudakwashe's throat. I knew it immediately. It ran along the walls like vines of ivy, but, as the doctor had said, it looked to be some sort of neural tissue. Somehow, it had the ability to hide itself from perception. This was what I'd stabbed into on that Zimbabwean rooftop, and this was what had made everyone around it scream and run at me to defend it. How had it done that? Did it generate some kind of neural field to blanket our senses? What *was* this stuff? Clenching my fists to keep a hold of myself against the tide of caffeine, I followed the neural vines higher and higher with my sight. They'd grown over this building, in the alley in Jerusalem, and high up in Zimbabwe. Where else might these spots of infection be growing? I stepped out of the fetid alley to follow its run further, but froze in horrified awe as I got my first unedited visual of the sub-city. There were two perceptions there; one, the faux clean clone, the other a monstrously overgrown hive. My vision flickered as I tried to comprehend what I was seeing: *a veritable jungle of hanging neural vines, conduits, and pillars had grown across the entire city.* Thick masses hung between high buildings; curving nerves spread out fractally along nearby streets. The shock and the caffeine combined were too much. I fell to my knees at the whim of a body-wide seizing vomit. Worse, the pain in my temples had become what felt like motion, and a writhing therein made me scream and grip myself to fight for sanity. Static blurred my sight, random voices shouted in my hearing, and two long worms of strange tissue burrowed out the sides of my eyes, fell to the dirty street, and shriveled up. Drops of blood fell straight down from my vision as I stared at what had just crawled out of my temples and died on the ground before me. The caffeine wracked me with pain, but I knew now that I'd done it: I'd poisoned myself hard enough that my perceptions had finally become clear. What the hell were they? Entities in their own right? Or just some form of connection to the previously invisible neural jungles growing all over the world? Had the human race evolved some sort of literal group hive mind, or were we under attack by something else? The madman. He'd written of this. He'd been intent on cutting the neural fibers out of my eyes directly. That's what he'd done to himself, and that was how he'd gained the ability to truly *see.* I'd chosen another route, but it had not been without its risks. I threw up twice more before losing consciousness on the sidewalk. Four hundred and fifteen milligrams of caffeine in a Venti black coffee, and I'd had seven. Five grams was a potentially lethal dose, and I'd had at least sixty percent of that. I descended into darkness with nothing but a small hope that my years as a coffee addict would see me through this. The first question I became aware of was simple. "" How did you do that?"" Several periods of blurred consciousness brought me to waking in a sealed underground parking lot that looked like it had never been finished. The man who had spoken was not present, but he soon visited with food and water. He asked again in perfect English, ""How did you do that?"" I shook with the after-effects of caffeine near-overdose, but managed to respond, ""Do what?"" He kicked me in the ribsnot too hard, just enough to show that he was seriousand I said, ""I'll tell you, just please clarify!"" He moved his wrinkled but hardened face closer and tapped my temple. "" Removed your blinders."" I winced at his touch before realizing the implications of his question. "" Wait, you're aware of them? Do you also see the world as it truly is?"" He gave me another sharp kick. "" I've tortured better men than you until they wished for death. Understand your position. I ask, you tell."" I nodded in acceptance. "" I, uh, took sixty percent of a lethal dose of caffeine."" His glare was sharp. "" How did you calculate a lethal dose? The same amount for others may kill them."" ""It was just a guess based on articles I've read,"" I protested, staving off another kick. "" I've been addicted to caffeine for years, so I may have withstood it better."" He pulled back. "" So her story was true. She watched you from our side of the border, and she said you drank coffee until you became violently ill."" I held up my hands to ward off the bright light that his change in position had cast upon me. "" Now a silhouette, he asked, ""And what did you see?"" ""Look,"" I told him, trying to think quickly. "" I don't think you and I are enemies. I've been pursued by crazy people, got my finger cut off, my ear sliced, some guy wanted to cut my eyesI have *no idea* what's going on, but I do think the human race is in serious trouble. There areGod, there's like some sort of infestation out thereit's everywhere! I think we're under attack!"" He gave a dark laugh and moved away, saying, ""You just saved your life, and you don't even know why."" A door slammed somewhere distant, and I was left alone in a poorly lit crumbled stone prison. I walked the length of my confinement for a few hours, finding a scattering of shitty fluorescent lights illuminating empty parking spots and incomplete stairwells. Some of these stairwells led up toward daylight very *very* high up, but nothing but sheer concrete and the occasional rotting foothold presented itself. They had no guards on this exit for a reason: the climb was suicide. An entire month passed before I received my next visitor. I was self-aware of the effects that solitary confinement was having on me, but this was no hallucination. The same man opened a door, but only his guest came inside; that creature that had once crawled out of my severed pinky finger now skittered into the room on bone-white blade-like legs. Ivory eyes watched me unblinking, and I heard its voice in my head again: *Are you done playing the fool?* There was no escape this time, but I still moved back a few steps. "" After a thought, I added, ""I understand what you meant now by my senses betraying me. I've seen it."" The question now is whether you are a double agent. It is exceedingly rare that a human being breaks free from the Entity on its own. Would you have us believe you are just that smart?* I looked past the Bonewalker toward the door where my human former interrogator stood. He seemed very uncomfortable with the creature's presence, and nodded for me to speak carefully. I finally said, ""A little smart, but mostly just way too addicted to caffeine."" It seemed to accept that answer. * You spoke of a man that tried to cut your eyes.* *Describe him.* I gave it the best description I could of the man with the wild glee and surgical knife, but I couldn't tell what it thought of my words. It left immediately, this time jumping into a small open wound on the man at the door's arm; he shivered, pulled a bandage over it, and closed the door. Was he a guard? Or someone higher level? If the crazy doctor was someone this group wanted, then I might have been regarded as a very important prisoner. Indeed, the quality of my given food rose, and guards came in to play cards with me and keep me company. I understood that this was both luxury for my information and a test of my true character; I made sure to be completely honest about every single thing they asked me. I had nothing to hide. I even told them about the breakup, and my hollow reactions to it. At the end of the second month, the Bonewalker returned. This time, I was in the open-topped stairwell standing in the rain, but it didn't seem to care about the falling liquid. * The guards seem to think you're not a liar.* I'd had plenty of time to craft my strategy. "" Tell me one thing. I assume the Entity is something related to the neural fibers growing all over the world. Are you opposed to it?"" The creature's ivory eyes gave no hint of connotation or elaboration. * ""Then that means we're on the same side,"" I told it, taking a risk. "" Regardless of whatever organization or power structure you've got control of."" *You would choose the more personable of two dooms?* it asked. * You will remain untreated, for it can sense the blood-bond. None of my humans can ever truly be a part of its society.* There was a chance I would come off as a double agent fishing for information, but I also genuinely wanted to know. "" How much do you control?"" *Thirty percent.* So the ghettos had been made terrifying in our perceptions on purpose to separate us from the opposition. "" Thirty percent of China, that's a sizable""
*Of the Earth,* it responded. A clicking followed, a sound I took to be laughter. * You're not a double agent. You're too full of yourself, like most humans. Know that you will be watched, and if you betray us, you will die in the manner you are most afraid of.* Could it see that? Could it see my fears? I gulped as it crawled away without another word. And what of being watched? Did it mean I was to be released? The third month was full of tension and confusion. Gone were the guards and the visits. Had I done something wrong? Finally, the man who had first interrogated me dragged me out the door and up a long set of stairs to release me into a moderately disheveled area that I might once have seen as ruined and horrible. After undoing a temporary pair of handcuffs, he told me, ""That doctor has a special interest in you. Let him find you, then bring him to us. He is very important to this fight."" I nodded, and accepted money and a folded set of clothes from him. ""And take a shower,"" he said as a final note of goodbye. "" I did reekbut there was wind to carry the smell away and a sun in the sky. I was free. Wandering the streets and watching the poor go about their lives the best they could with what they had on hand, I realized that life was precious. I'd been doing nothing with it since I'd been hollowed out by someone I'd loved, and yet here there were people that did not have the suits or the offices or the coffeepeople making do, raising kids, and having afternoon chats from window to window. This was the Bonewalker's territory, and it was not altogether bad. The divide between territories was stark. Neural masses hung from building to building directly across the final street, and I could see raised lines of parasitic flesh along the temples of passersby. My God, it hadn't been a caffeine nightmare! Seventy percent of the Earth had been overtaken by an infection of unknown proportions, and the other thirty percent held fast only under the vicious rule of the Bonewalker. Where was the human spirit in all this? Where was *our* faction? Eyes were upon me even thenfrom both sidesso I resolved to keep my counsel to myself. If there was to be one at all, I had to be the start of our faction. I'd figured this out myself, freed my own perceptions through risk and calculated daring, and I'd dodged the Bonewalker's control as well. I knew who my first true ally would be, too: the very man that creature wanted. Who are you, Doctor? What do you have that both these nightmares want? I've left enough keywords in this for you to find it, and I know you're obsessive enough to contact me despite the risk. I'm back in the States, and I have a suspicion you know where to find me. ---

"Health update I'm getting so much better. Even little things like my skin not being so damn see through, my pigment is coming back. :) I've noticed so many positive changes, especially with my gut and my mind. The brain fog is gone. I can concentrate, I feel sane and normal again. I am finally getting some energy back, I still get some serious fatigue almost everyday between 3-6. Today was amazing. First day I woke up without stomach pain that lasts for hours! It's been 8.5 days with a candida friendly paleo ish diet and I gotta say, as a sugar/carb addict this has been as hard as quitting smokes, but honestly so worth it. I've gotten back in touch with my cooking side and have had fun doing weird shit I've always wanted to do like toast and grind my own millet, I burnt a bunch too! I feel like I've been under some moldy tarp and finally the air roots of this orchid popped through. I'll be back real soon. Right in time for the flowers :)
Struggles I'm having are definitely die off symptoms from the Candida, some serious fucking cravings, porn like dreams of whipped cream, and just overall hunger from no carbs (30g/day avg), and of course feeling chained to my kitchen.",NO_SYMPTOMS,"The person who wrote this post claims to have good concentration and to feel healthy, so there is no reference to loss of cognitive ability or deteriorated mood in the last two weeks.
