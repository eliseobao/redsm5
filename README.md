## Abstract
Depression is a pervasive mental health condition that affects hundreds of millions of individuals worldwide, yet many cases remain undiagnosed due to barriers in traditional clinical access and pervasive stigma. Social media platforms, and Reddit in particular, offer rich, user-generated narratives that can reveal early signs of depressive symptomatology. However, existing computational approaches often label entire posts simply as *depressed* or *not depressed*, without linking language to specific criteria from the DSM-5, the standard clinical framework for diagnosing depression. This limits both clinical relevance and interpretability. To address this gap, we introduce *ReDSM5*, a novel Reddit corpus comprising 1484 long-form posts, each exhaustively annotated at the sentence level by a licensed psychologist for the nine DSM-5 depression symptoms. For each label, the annotator also provides a concise clinical rationale grounded in DSM-5 methodology. We conduct an exploratory analysis of the collection, examining lexical, syntactic, and emotional patterns that characterize symptom expression in social media narratives. Compared to prior resources, *ReDSM5* uniquely combines symptom-specific supervision with expert explanations, facilitating the development of models that not only detect depression but also generate human-interpretable reasoning. We establish baseline benchmarks for both multi-label symptom classification and explanation generation, providing reference results for future research on detection and interpretability.

## 📊 Dataset Overview

The **ReDSM5** corpus is a carefully curated collection of Reddit posts annotated for the nine clinical symptoms of depression defined by the DSM-5. Each post is analyzed at the sentence level by a licensed psychologist, and every label includes a concise clinical rationale. This section summarizes the dataset's main statistics and symptom distribution.

### 🧮 Main Statistics

| Statistic             | Value  | Description                                                                      |
| --------------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Number of posts       | 1,484  | Unique Reddit posts reconstructed from the DepreSym corpus                       |
| Number of negatives   | 392    | Posts that were flagged during BDI-II annotation but did not meet DSM-5 criteria |
| Average symptoms/post | 1.04   | Most posts describe only one or no symptoms                                      |
| Average words/post    | 294.71 | Posts range from brief complaints to detailed narratives                         |
| Minimum words/post    | 2      | Very short posts included for completeness                                       |
| Maximum words/post    | 6,990  | Long-form self-disclosures are common on Reddit                                  |

> The presence of 392 "negative" cases provides valuable contrastive examples for learning fine-grained clinical distinctions in language.

### 📌 Symptom Frequency

| Symptom                | Occurrences | Notes                                                  |
| ---------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Depressed mood         | 328         | Most frequently annotated symptom                      |
| Worthlessness          | 311         | Often expressed through self-blame or low self-worth   |
| Suicidal thoughts      | 165         | High-risk content with strong clinical relevance       |
| Fatigue                | 124         | Includes both physical and mental exhaustion           |
| Anhedonia              | 124         | Loss of interest or pleasure in usual activities       |
| Sleep issues           | 102         | Mentions of insomnia, oversleeping, or disturbed sleep |
| Cognitive issues       | 59          | Concentration problems or decision-making difficulties |
| Appetite change        | 44          | Includes increased or decreased appetite               |
| Psychomotor alteration | 35          | Least common, often subtle in textual form             |

> The distribution is imbalanced across symptoms. This reflects clinical reality and presents additional challenges for multi-label classification, particularly for low-frequency classes such as appetite change and psychomotor alteration.

### 🏷️ Named Entity Distribution

We applied Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify structured elements such as dates, time spans, quantities, and people across DSM-5 symptom categories.

![Named Entity Recognition](analysis/visuals/png/ner.png)

Temporal entities (DATE and TIME) were especially prevalent in *depressed mood*, *sleep issues*, and *suicidal thoughts*, reflecting the importance of time references in depressive narratives.

### 🧠 Topic Modeling

We used Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to uncover thematic contrasts between posts with and without DSM-5 symptoms.

![WordCloud NO symptoms](analysis/visuals/png/wordcloud_NO_symptoms.png)
![WordCloud symptoms](analysis/visuals/png/wordcloud_symptoms.png)

Posts without symptoms focused on hobbies and niche interests (e.g., "vanguard", "sampson"), whereas symptomatic posts emphasized introspection and affective language with words like "feel", "life", and "psychosis".

### 🎭 Emotion and Sentiment Profile

We analyzed emotional tone using the NRC Emotion Lexicon (based on Plutchik’s model), computing the proportion of emotion-related words per symptom class.

<div align="center">
  <img src="analysis/visuals/png/plutchik.png" alt="Plutchik wheel of emotions" width="400"/>
</div>

* *Suicidal thoughts* posts showed the highest levels of **sadness** and **fear**
* *Anhedonia* was marked by low **joy** and **trust**
* *Sleep issues* displayed a neutral emotional pattern

These findings indicate that individual symptoms carry distinct emotional signals in social media narratives.

### ✍️ Grammar and Pronoun Use

We examined grammatical patterns by analyzing verb tense and pronoun usage across symptom categories.

#### Verb Tense Distribution (%)

| Symptom                | Past  | Present | Future |
| ---------------------- | ----- | ------- | ------ |
| No symptoms            | 49.99 | 38.96   | 11.04  |
| Depressed mood         | 42.74 | 46.40   | 10.86  |
| Anhedonia              | 26.51 | 61.83   | 11.67  |
| Appetite change        | 40.33 | 50.23   | 9.44   |
| Sleep issues           | 46.19 | 43.03   | 10.78  |
| Psychomotor alteration | 40.55 | 47.81   | 11.64  |
| Fatigue                | 39.37 | 48.04   | 12.59  |
| Worthlessness          | 36.32 | 52.13   | 11.55  |
| Cognitive issues       | 31.31 | 55.98   | 12.71  |
| Suicidal thoughts      | 30.55 | 57.44   | 12.01  |

#### Pronoun Usage (%)

| Symptom                | FPS   | FPP  | SP   | TPS   | TPP  |
| ---------------------- | ----- | ---- | ---- | ----- | ---- |
| No symptoms            | 51.84 | 5.21 | 8.41 | 30.37 | 4.16 |
| Depressed mood         | 63.52 | 3.84 | 6.11 | 22.43 | 4.09 |
| Anhedonia              | 69.86 | 1.69 | 6.57 | 19.18 | 2.69 |
| Appetite change        | 68.98 | 1.17 | 5.38 | 19.95 | 4.52 |
| Sleep issues           | 65.23 | 2.53 | 7.29 | 21.11 | 3.84 |
| Psychomotor alteration | 64.60 | 2.48 | 7.13 | 22.23 | 3.56 |
| Fatigue                | 63.01 | 4.36 | 7.79 | 21.25 | 3.58 |
| Worthlessness          | 67.50 | 2.61 | 6.09 | 20.94 | 2.85 |
| Cognitive issues       | 68.30 | 1.66 | 3.32 | 24.23 | 2.49 |
| Suicidal thoughts      | 66.84 | 1.21 | 6.21 | 22.69 | 3.05 |

Symptomatic posts consistently used more first-person singular (FPS) pronouns and present-tense verbs, indicating a personal and immediate tone. In contrast, non-symptomatic posts relied more on past tense and third-person singular (TPS), reflecting retrospective or external narratives.
